A note on naming child themes:

If you are going to mod themes, be aware that any child themes need to be listed lexographically after the parent theme.  This means if you are going to use a theme as a parent theme your child theme must be named in such a way that it is listed after that theme.  A good rule of thumb is to follow the naming convention used by Stormtrooper and name your child theme, "[parent theme name]-[child theme name]", for example "default-pinkninjas".  That will ensure that the child theme is listed lexographically after the parent theme.
