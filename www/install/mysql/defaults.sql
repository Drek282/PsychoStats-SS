            <p>If profiles, user logins and image uploads are enabled and you upload images to your profile you should avoid uploading images with embedded location data (EXIF GPS) included. Anyone viewing your images can download and extract any location data from those images.</p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>When you visit the site, a temporary cookie is set to save your session data. This cookie contains no personal information and is kept until your browser is closed. It\'s primary function is to store and retrieve login status when you have an account.  It also gathers some technical browser information to allow for browser specific code in displaying pages.</p>
            <p>A cookie is also set that is persistent that allows for the storage and retrieval of your theme preference.  Neither of these two cookies are tracking cookies or are used for any purpose other than those stated here.</p>
            <h3>Cookie Consent</h3>
            <p>By default no cookies will be saved in your browser.  You must accept cookies for them to be saved in your browser.  If you do not accept cookies you will be able to browse the stats but you will not be able to register or log into an account if those options are enabled or you already have an account.  You will also not be able to log into an admin account if you have one or choose anything other than the default theme or language support.</p>
            <h3>Embedded content from other websites</h3>
            <p>Profiles on this site may include embedded content (e.g. images, links, etc.). Embedded content from other websites behaves in the exact same way as if the visitor has visited the other website.</p>
            <p>These websites may collect data about you, use cookies, embed additional third-party tracking, and monitor your interaction with that embedded content, including tracking your interaction with the embedded content if you have an account and are logged in to that website.</p>
            <h3>How long we retain your data</h3>
            <p>If you create a profile, your profile and its metadata are retained indefinitely.</p>
            <p>For users that register in PsychoStats, we also store the personal information they provide in their user profile. All users can see, edit, or delete their personal information at any time (except they cannot change their username), unless user logins are subsequently disabled. PsychoStats users with administrator accounts can see and edit that information at any time.</p>
            <p>A history of Scoresheet owner names is visible to users that are logged in on each team page.  These names are scraped from the official Scoresheet player stats pages where they are viewable by anyone.  If anyone has a problem with this, they need to take the issue up with Scoresheet Games.</p>
            <p>The user profiles and the information contained in them are only visible to users that are logged in.  Every effort has been made to ensure that PschoStats for Scoresheet Baselball users are Scoresheet team owners, but there are no guarantees in that regard.</p>
