<h2 id="go-hdr"><#Congratulations! PsychoStats has been installed!#></h2>
<p>
	PsychoStats version <b>{ps->version}</b> has been successfully installed on your web server!
</p>
<p>
	Before your team statistics start to work you need to setup the PsychoStats backend, which consists of
	the perl stats.pl script and other libraries that actually process logs and create the statistics for your
	website. For more information view the INSTALL file included with the PsychoStats archive.
</p>
<p>
	You should also login with your admin user and make sure your PsychoStats configuration is setup the way you want it.
	You absolutely need to setup a log source at a bare minimum, otherwise PsychoStats won't know where to read your log files from.
